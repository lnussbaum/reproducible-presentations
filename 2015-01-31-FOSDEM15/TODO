mention 
	the order of the slides party feels somewhat wrong
		srebuild too early
		"Reproduce the build environment" feels out of place + little info
	
	not mentioned at all yet: strip_nondeterminism and dh_stripnoterminism
	

	status / goals / help
	whats next
		help: dak integration, .buildinfo files integrated in the archive #bugnumber
			do we have a bug?
		include/check: status+next from main wiki page

	maybe make this more clear: "jenkins.d.n is just a QA tool", no real results yet. post jessie.

	bsd+suse+hurd+more logos to BSD / SLES page


	add list of variations we dont test (but exist in the wild)
		- uname / kernel
		- build date (we do have time)
		- cpu type 
		- more generally, all the hardware itself (hopefully not relevant, but...)




	maybe not in slides, but in our mind, i want to ask the audience:
		- who was there last year at the talk?
		- who is not using debian or derivatives?
		- contributing...
		- who has done some work on build reproducibility
	asking questions in the beginning is good for two things:
		- wake people up / get their attention
		- increase the participation, show that i care. also its really interesting (if the questions are good :)
