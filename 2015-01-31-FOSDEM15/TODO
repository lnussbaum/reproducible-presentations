upload the slides to penta


	maybe make this more clear: "jenkins.d.n is just a QA tool", no real results yet. post jessie.

	not in slides, but in our mind, i want to ask the audience:
		- who was there last year at the talk?
		- who is not using debian or derivatives?
		- who is contributing to FLOSS
		- who has done some work on build reproducibility
