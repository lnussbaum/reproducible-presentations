mention 
	the order of the slides party feels somewhat wrong
		srebuild too early
		"Reproduce the build environment" feels out of place + little info
	
	status / goals / help
		help: dak integration, .buildinfo files integrated in the archive #763822
		Require matching binary packages from the developer and a buildd before accepting the package in the archive. This could initially be opt-in. 

	maybe make this more clear: "jenkins.d.n is just a QA tool", no real results yet. post jessie.

	bsd+suse+hurd+more logos to BSD / SLES page

	aspect:
		text in slide #38 overflows
		exclamation mark in slide #103 goes to newline

	not in slides, but in our mind, i want to ask the audience:
		- who was there last year at the talk?
		- who is not using debian or derivatives?
		- who is contributing to FLOSS
		- who has done some work on build reproducibility
