	include status+next from main wiki page

	"jenkins.d.n is just a QA tool", no real results yet. post jessie.
	security is a process. QA too. please help. both.


	binary transparency logs - describe the concept briefly

	add list of fixed packages in our repo
	add list of variations we dont test:
		- uname
		- build date (we do have time)



	maybe not in slides, but in our mind, i want to ask the audience:
		- who was there last year at the talk?
		- who is not using debian or derivatives?
		- contributing...
		- who has done some work on build reproducibility
	asking questions in the beginning is good for two things:
		- wake people up / get their attention
		- increase the participation, show that i care. also its really interesting (if the questions are good :)
